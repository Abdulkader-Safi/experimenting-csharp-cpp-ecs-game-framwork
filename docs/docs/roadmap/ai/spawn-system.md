# Spawn System

:::info Planned
This feature is not yet implemented.
:::

Create entities at runtime (enemies, projectiles, particles).

## Planned Scope

- Spawn from prefab templates
- Spawn points (position + optional direction)
- Wave-based spawning (timed enemy waves)
- Pool recycling (reuse despawned entities instead of creating new ones)
