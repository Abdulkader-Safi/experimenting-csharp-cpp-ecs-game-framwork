:::info Planned
This feature is not yet implemented.
:::

Vertex-level deformation for facial expressions and other fine-grained mesh changes.

## Planned Scope

- Parse morph target data from glTF
- Blend between base mesh and morph targets
- Multiple simultaneous morph weights
- GPU morph target evaluation
