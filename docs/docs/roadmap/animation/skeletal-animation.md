:::info Planned
This feature is not yet implemented.
:::

Bone hierarchy, skinning weights, and joint transforms from glTF skins.

## Planned Scope

- Parse skeleton data from glTF (joints, inverse bind matrices)
- Skinning weights per vertex (up to 4 joints)
- Joint transform hierarchy (parent-child bones)
- GPU skinning in the vertex shader
