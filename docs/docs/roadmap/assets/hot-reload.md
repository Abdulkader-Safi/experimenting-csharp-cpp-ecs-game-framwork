# Hot Reloading (Assets)

:::info Planned
Asset hot reloading is not yet implemented. Game logic hot reloading is available now via `make dev` — see [Hot Reload](/features/hot-reload).
:::

Detect file changes and reload assets (meshes, textures, shaders) at runtime.

## Planned Scope

- File watcher for asset directories
- Automatic reload of modified meshes, textures, and shaders
- Shader recompilation on save
- No application restart required
