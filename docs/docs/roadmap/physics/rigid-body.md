# Rigid Body Dynamics

:::info Planned
This feature is not yet implemented.
:::

Gravity, velocity, mass, forces, and impulses.

## Planned Scope

- RigidBody component (mass, velocity, angular velocity)
- Gravity and force accumulation
- Impulse-based collision response
- Static vs dynamic vs kinematic body types
- Integration (Euler or Verlet)
