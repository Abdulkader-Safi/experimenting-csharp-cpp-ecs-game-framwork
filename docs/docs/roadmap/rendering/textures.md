# Textures & UV Mapping

:::info Planned
This feature is not yet implemented.
:::

Load textures from glTF files, sample them in the fragment shader, and add UV coordinates to the vertex format.

## Planned Scope

- Parse texture data from glTF (base color map)
- Add UV coordinates to the vertex buffer layout
- Create Vulkan image/sampler resources
- Sample textures in the fragment shader
- Support PNG/JPEG embedded or external textures
