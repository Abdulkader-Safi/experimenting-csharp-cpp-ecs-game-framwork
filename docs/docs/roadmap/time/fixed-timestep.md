# Fixed Timestep

:::info Planned
This feature is not yet implemented.
:::

Consistent physics updates regardless of framerate.

## Planned Scope

- Fixed update loop (e.g., 60 Hz physics)
- Accumulator pattern for frame-independent physics
- Separate fixed-update system registration
- Interpolation for smooth rendering between fixed steps
